# Cutting through the FUD; Facts you should know about Hyper-V and System Center

I'm not sure the retweet tag (RT) also applies to blogs or not, but I thought I'd give it a try. Now to my point. Edwin posted a [good blog](https://blogs.technet.com/virtplanet/archive/2009/12/19/cutting-through-the-fud-facts-you-should-know-about-hyper-v-and-system-center.aspx "Edwin's blog") this evening about re-occurring Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt the spreads via traditional journalism or blogs. I don't know for sure, but I suspect his post had something to do with an InformationWeek blog posted by an [SI partner of VMware](http://www.artemistechnology.com/partner.aspx?id=57 "Artemis website"). I recommend reading Edwin's post. Here's a summary of his points: 

  * **You do not need to remove or replace your existing VMware installation to deploy Hyper-V  **
  * **Hyper-V and the rest of Microsoft Virtualization is “Enterprise ready” for hundreds of companies today**.
  * **Virtual Machine Manager is not a replacement for vCenter**  
  * **Hyper-V is a mature, safe, secure hypervisor  **

Have a great holiday.
